# RAT-via-Telegram

Windows Remote Administration Tool via Telegram

### Why another one?

The current Remote Administration Tools in the market face 2 major problems:

- Lack of encryption
- Require port forwarding in order to control from hundreds of miles

This RAT overcomes both these issues by using the Telegram bot API.

- Fully encrypted. The data being exchanged cannot be spied upon using MITM tools
- Telegram messenger app provides a simple way to communicate to the target without configuring port forward before hand on the target

## Features:

- Run keylogger on the target PC
- Get target PC's Windows version, processor and more.
- List any directories on the target. Download any file locally from the target PC in the background.
- Upload local files on to the target PC. Just send any file to the Telegram bot that you wish to upload.
- Screenshots of the target PC.
- Take snapshots from the webcam (if attached)
- Self-Destruct RAT with a single command
- Many more coming soon!
